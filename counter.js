  //Given that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds. Write a function called convertToSeconds that takes in the number of minutes as an arguments and returns the seconds equivalent in the format ```x seconds``` e.g 120 seconds, 300 seconds. e.t.c. If the seconds equivalent is 0, then it should just return 0, if the seconds equivalent is 1, then it should return 1, if the seconds equivalent is more than 1, then it should return with the string "seconds"  


  //Write a function called greater that takes in three numbers as arguments and returns the greatest number among the three. If they are all equal, it should return any of them.  

  let a;
  let b;
  let c;

  function greater(a,b,c){
    if(a>)
  }
  //Write a function called least that takes in three numbers as arguments and returns the least among the three. If they are all equal, it should return any of them


  //Write a function called isEven that takes in a number as an argument, the function returns true if a number is even and returns false if a number is odd. Use this function to log to the console all the even numbers between 0 and 101.
